    %% IMPORTANT MESSAGE (Dec 2016)
    %% Due to the recent numerous changes requested by IPS, USM to different
    %% candidates -- often conflicting even within the same week -- without much
    %% consistency nor in black in white, I have found it increasingly difficult
    %% to maintain a coherent version. I have therefore decided to provide some
    %% options that seem to be favored by IPS on different occasions; but will no
    %% longer update the template until an updated formatting guidelines with clear
    %% instructions and concrete samples is published.
    %%
    %% THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER UPDATES UNTIL IPS-USM PUBLISHES AN OFFICIAL
    %% UPDATED FORMATTING GUIDELINES WITH CONCRETE, CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS.
    %%
    %% Individual requests for help to modify this version for your needs will be
    %% handled on a case by case basis, depending on my mood, perhaps for a fee.
    %% Requests for help to modify past versions will NOT be entertained.
    %% Please read http://tex.my/how-to-ask-for-latex-related-help-effectively/.
    %%
    %% (Yes I'm that tired and frustrated. I know everyone just want to graduate,
    %% but I am by now genuinely put off by the tone of some requests with rude
    %% attitudes, unclear descriptions, flip-flopping conditions, etc for something
    %% that was originally for my own use.)
    %%
    %% Usmthesis _was_ fun; but it has ceased to be so for me.
    %%
    %% Submit a git pull request on https://github.com/liantze/usmthesis
    %% if you wish to contribute your changes. No timeframe is set for approvals.
    %% I cannot check through any edited usmthesis.cls of any version without
    %% CVS.
    %%
    %% Oh and if you'd like to adapt this template (the .cls and/or the .tex) for
    %% your institution, that's perfectly fine, but at least keep the license
    %% (LPPL 1.3) and the original author (me) won't you? It's just normal decency.
    %% THANK you. :-)
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    %% If you prefer -- and have been allowed -- to use
    %% Arial, then
    %% \documentclass[arial]{usmthesis}
    %% It's not really Arial, it's a Helvetica look-alike,
    %% but if you're not a designer nor a typographer, you
    %% probably can't tell the difference (I can't either)
    %%
    %% OTHER IMPORTANT OPTIONS:
    %% singespacetitle - Make title on cover and title
    %%                   page single-spaced.
    %%
    %% chapnumwords — Make chapter titles be `Chapter One'
    %% tocchapnumwords — Make the ToC use `Chaper One' too
    %%   (Engineering IPS seems to like the above two settings)
    %%
    %% tocpage   These options will add a ``Page'' label at the
    %% lotpage   top of the Table of Contents, List of Tables,
    %% lofpage   List of Figures and List of Plates respectively.
    %% loppage   I don't know lah, one moment IPS says must add at
    %%           the top of all these lists; one month later say
    %%           only the ToC, a few months later say don't add at all.
    %%           Find, mix-and-match yourself based on the instrustions you got.
    %%
    %% tocCAPSfront - Sometimes IPS wants the ``Table of Contents'', ``List of
    %%                Figures'', ``Abstract'' etc to be all-caps in the ToC;
    %%                sometimes they don't. Use this option to make them ALL CAPS.
    %%
    %% tocCAPSref - Similar to the above but for the ``References''.
    %% tocCAPSapp - Similar to the above but for the ``Appendices''.
