%% Example of loading other packages that you may require.
%% I'm loading the marvosym package so that I can produce a
%% smiley face with the command \Smiley.
\usepackage{marvosym}

%% Also, the enumitem package is great for customising
%% list environments.
\usepackage{enumitem}

%% Listings is a nice package for typesetting code
%% listings. Other possible packages include fancyvrb,
%% minted, etc.
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{basicstyle=\ttfamily,breaklines=true}

%% For those who need to produce algorithms and pseudocode.
%% There are a number of different packages available, but
%% unfortunately they tend not to work well together!
%% I'm using algorithmicx, specifically algpseucode, here.
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{algorithm}

% As we have loaded the natbib package, you can customise
% the citation style to some extent.  The following line
% specifies some standard punctuations:
%
% \bibpunct{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4}{#5}{#6}
% #1: open punctuation (a round bracket here)
% #2: close punctuation (a round bracket here)
% #3: punctuation separating multiple authors (a semi-colon here)
% #4: n - citation using numerical system
%     s - numeric superscript system
%     any other letter - author-year system
% #5: punctuation separating author name(s) from year
% #6: punctuation separating years for multiple citations
%     with same author(s)
%
% The default citation that I used here is therefore of the form
% (Wilks and Stevenson, 1999; Somers, 2000)
%
% You may change any of the 6 parameters if you prefer a
% different citation style.  Also see the natbib documentation.

% You can choose from several bibliography styles. I'm using

% entries here, but feel free to experiment with other styles.
%
% If you prefer the number system though, use bibliography
% style "plainnat" for [1][2][3] or "alpha" for [Jon94] (the label
% will be auto-generated).
