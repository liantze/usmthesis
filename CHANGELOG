BRIEF CHANGELOG
===============
v1.7  Dec 08 2016
    - FINAL UPDATE BEFORE v2.0, which will only be possible when IPS
      officially publishes the updated formatted guidelines and samples, and
      if there is any real interest for a new version at all.
    - Added a bunch of new document class options that you can mix and match
      to appease IPS' various combinations of requirements. PLEASE READ THE
      COMMENTS AT THE TOP AND THROUGHOUT usmthesis.tex.

v1.67 Oct 05 2016
    - Refactored code in .cls.
    - Chapter heading spacing should be more consistent now.
    - Multiline figure and table captions should now have page numbers aligned
      with first line. (Not fixed for chapter/section headings; IMHO these
      should be kept short.)
    - Added some examples to usmthesis.tex to handle cases when IPS requests
      for no page numbers/no ToC entries for appendices etc.

v1.66 Apr 13 2016
    - First pages of appendix chapters don't have footers now.

v1.65 Mar 22 2016
    - Titles on cover/title pages now double-spaced

v1.64 Mar 20 2016
    - First paragraphs after each sectional heading is
      now indented

v1.63 Mar 3 2016
    - Moved List of Publications to after Appendices
    - References heading has 5cm top margin

v1.62 Feb 17 2016
    - Turn off page numbering for appendices in the ToC
    - Appendix chapters are un-bold in the ToC now

v1.61 Sep 22 2015
    - Abstract titles are now 12pt (irrespective of the font being used)
    - Default bibliography style is now APA
      (with \RequirePackage[natbibapa]{apacite})

v1.6 Aug 21 2015
    - (Based on feedback from Puan Nurul Hasyda of IPS)
    - Chapters are now in bold in the TOC.
    - Eliminated vertical spaces at the top and bottom of cover and
      title page.
    - Apparently if using Times, must be in 12pt. So no more 11pt,
      12pt choices. But sans serif (Arial) is allowed again, but must
      be at 11pt.
    - Instead, the "times" option loads mathptmx 12pt as body font,
      and "arial" option loads "helvet" 11pt as body font.

v1.5 Apr 16 2015
    - Thesis titles in abstracts are now double-spaced if >1 lines, and
      are smaller than the "Abstract"/"Abstrak" keywords.

v1.4 Apr 14 2015
   - Now works with updated acronym package
   - Finally using bahasam babel option (and removed the french language,
     couldn't remember why I didn't remove it after some personal tests)

v1.3 May 12 2012
    - Refined spacing in bibliography list and after chapter heading
    - Fixed font size in cover (from 17pt to 18pt)
    - User can now specify preferred document body font size (11pt or 12pt)
       as a class option. The default is 11pt.
    - Changed font sizes of section, subsection headings to \normalsize.

v1.2 Nov 15 2007
   - New thesis format in force as of 16 November 2007!
   - There is now no times, helvet or cm options. Body font is now
     Times Roman for serif type, Helvetica for sans serif type, and
     TX Typewriter for typewriter font.
   - Bottom page margin increased to 4.0cm.
   - Page number now placed 1.0cm from bottom edge of paper.
   - All text on title page are now in bold.
   - Title of bibliography/references is now "REFERENCES".
   - Introduced new "plate" float and "List of Plates".
   - List of Publications is now moved to *after* appendices.
   - Re-formatting of the table of contents:
     * all text are unformatted (chapter headings are neither in bold nor
       using larger font size
     * dotted leader between titles and page number
     * larger separation between (sub)section numbers and titles to resemble
       the sample in the guidelines more closely
   - Fixed bug in definition of \chapter to honour short title in
     \chapter[short title]{full title}

v1.1 May 20 2007
   - re-definition of \chapter, therefore eliminating the need for \mychapter.
     Various GUI LaTeX editors will now recognise the chapter divisions.
   - added \RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}.
   - updated quickstart.tex: removed note about \mychapter.

   - introduced class options for:
       * body font scheme (on suggestion by Dr Dhanesh)
       * style of URLs
       * whether figures are framed by default (on feedback from Anusha and
         Seng Soon).
   - updated usmthesis.tex to describe how to do common tasks in LaTeX
   - new quickstart.tex to describe how to use usmthesis.cls and accompanying
     template files.

v0.1 Nov 29 2005
   - first stab at usmthesis as a package (usmthesis.sty).
